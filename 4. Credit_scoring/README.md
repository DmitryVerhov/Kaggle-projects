### Credit scoring
The goal of this work is to predict the Bank borrower's status by training the model. We have been provided with information from the borrower's personal data and the fact of a default. 
This is my first try to create linear regression model. During this work I've passed throught all the steps of model creation proceess:
* Prepare and cleaning data;
* Perform exploratory data analysis;
* Generate some new features.
* Preprocess data for the model
* Trained Logistic regression model with different parameters 
### Conclusion
I have tested four variants of Logistic regression model and cleared out that the most influence on the result has a class_weight parameter. On my opinion, it will be useful to get more data about default borrowers to eliminate the disproportion between 'good' and 'bad' clients.
