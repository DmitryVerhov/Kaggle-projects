## Study projects (kaggle competitons) 
### This repository contains projects that I've comleted during my study for the Data Science specialization. Each of it is a kaggle competition:
* Credit scoring - predict the Bank borrower's status by training the linear regression model.
* Car price prediction - predict prices of cars with several methods and compare the results. Dataset was created independently by parsing auto.ru.  
* Image classification  - car model prediction by image using EfficientNetB6 neural network (transfer learning and fine-tune). 
* Multi-input neural network - Here I've had to work with three types of data: tabular, textual and visual. To solve this task, I assembled a multi-inpul neural network.
