## Study projects 
### This repository contains projects that I've comleted during my study for the Data Science specialization. Each of it is a kaggle competition:
* Credit scoring - predict the Bank borrower's status by training the linear regression model.
* Car price prediction - predict prices of cars with several methods and compare the results. Dataset was created independently by parsing auto.ru.
