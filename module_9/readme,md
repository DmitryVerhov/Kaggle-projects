# Car price prediction: part two

### The goal of this work was to predict the car price using provided data. The data contains csv+- file with characteristics and image files. As we have different types of data, I have used several methods to deal with them:
#### * classic ML method(Catboost), tabular NN for tabular data;
#### * NLP NN (LSTM,Convolutional NN, BERT) for text of descriptions;
#### * Computer vision NN (EfficientnetB6) for images;
#### * Ensembling models and blending their predictions.

### At first I have investigated and cleaned data, then made an EDA and preprocessing data to train models on it. During the work I have gathered metrics for models, that are presented in a table below:

#### As we can see the best result on submission was shown by Catboost + final by Blending. As for NLP models, the best result has a Convolutional network. I've said above that there are not enough data for LSTM and something wrong with BERT properties.
#### Nevertheless, I've improved my skills in text preprocessing and assembling neural networks. As for BERT, I will spend more time to learn this model better, because this is a stae-of-the-art method and DataScientist must know how to use it, if he wants to keep up with the times.
